# Demo of Dorametrix Bitbucket Pipe

This repository demonstrates using the [Dorametrix Bitbucket Pipe](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/dorametrix-pipe).

**View `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` for details.**

_Something is a bit wonky when it comes to expanding the environment variables; the solution presented should be "by the letter", though._

## Configuration

You will need to set secrets for `ENDPOINT` and `API_KEY` in accordance with the overall [Dorametrix](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/dorametrix) requirements.

## Remember...

- Always ensure you have secure settings regarding what actions you allow.
- Note that Dorametrix will _not_ work without access to the Git history.
